Grades:  check(-) :  some major problems with the codes and/or analysis
         check    :  good (with some minor gaps in your results/analysis) 
         check(+) :  excellent 
         check(++) : excellent with one of the BONUS problems completed

A few suggestions for the analysis:  

1) It'd be helpful to plot the exact wf on your plots per the problem statement. 
2) A bit more detail is needed on the analysis for #3. Hint: Physically, what does b control?
3) b should have no bearing on the normalization of psi(r). A good way to check this is to 
actually compute the normalization integral.  

Grade: check
