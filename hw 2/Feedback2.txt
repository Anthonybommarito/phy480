Your codes look fine and the analysis is not crazy, but it's missing a few things:

1) Always include fit lines (and corresponding fit params) in your figures
2) Where's the GSL results on the figure?
3) The Milne results look slightly off (also, why so few points?)
4) Include .plt files for ease of reproducing/checking results

Grade: check
