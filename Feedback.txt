# HW grading scale: check(+) --> excellent (good code and analysis) 
#                   check    --> satisfactory (minor shortcomings in code and/or analysis)
#                   check(-) --> significant problems w/code or analysis


1) Problem 1 (area.cpp embellishments): 

* Your code looks ok, though 1 minor nitpick is that the area function is a little  
counterintuitive since you pass in the radius squared. (Better to write functions
where it's clear as possible what's being computed.)

* Even though version control tools like GitHub make this less important (since you
can and should comment what you changed with each commit), it's still a good practice
to actually write in the comments what you changed in the present code version (e.g.,
implemented items 1-6 in the todo list).

2)Problem 2 (sum up/down): 

* As mentioned in class, you need to go to rather high N (~10**7) to see the full pattern. With such
a large number, it's best to loop over the different N in logarithmic intervals (see the problem
hint on the webpage) so it doesn't take too long and so the graph isn't crammed full of data points.

* The analysis sounds a bit confused. Hint: what problem in one of our early sessions does the present one 
resemble? If a have a "big" number of the order of 1 or 10 or something, and I add a tiny number (< machine precision),
what happens?  
 
3) Problem 3 (bessel functions): 


* You identified the upward method as better for large x. What about at small x wherehe relative
difference is of order 1? Can you identify which one (if any) is most accurate 
in this region? Would the gsl results be of any help here?



4) Extra problem

* You started it and your code looks ok, but there's no plots or analysis.  

* To really answer if these are randomly distributed, you need to bin up the results and make a histogram
to see if if approaches a gaussian distribution (central limit and all that).

##### HW grade = check 


* Please make separate HW1, HW2,etc. subfolders.
